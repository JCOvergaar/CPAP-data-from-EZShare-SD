Why did I do this?
I got tired of taking my SD card out of my Airsense 11 every few days to import data into OSCAR, so I looked for an alternate option.

The mainstream companies that created wifi SD cards discontinued them years ago and they are very expensive on the resale market.
It looks like the only option still being made is the EzShare -- an inexpensive card/adapter intended for cameras, a knockoff of the EyeFi.

Last year, I ran across a post from someone who had to use an EzShare SD card a few years ago. 
They weren't successful with it, but they made enough progress that I was willing to try it out.

This may only work with the newer models, which are white. I don't have the older orange card to test with.

The EZShare is currently  made in two varieties -- one is an actual SD card (in various capacities) with wireless built in. 
The other is an adapter for a microSD card. 

I purchased a couple of the adapter versions for ~$20 each on Ali Express (item #2251832428648118), but you can get them from other places, too. 
(I figure the adapter version with name brand memory purchased from a trusted seller might be more reliable than the ones with built in memory.)

After a fair amount of messing around with the card, and the notes from the other fellow's abandoned attempt, I was able to put a shell script together that sort of worked late last year. 
I played with it a bit but it wasn't very reliable and I shelved it.

I need to learn Python for my new job, and I decided to dig it out as a project to familarize myself with the language while potentially creating something useful.

I hope it works for you!

PS - Feel free to fork this if you know the file structure for other high-quality CPAP/BiPAP devices that log meaningful data to the card.
