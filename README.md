# **EzShare ResMed**
This script assists in using a WiFi enabled SD card by EzShare in your CPAP/BiPap device. This is coded for use with most ResMed devices from version 9 and up. Feel free to fork it for use with Philips Respironics and other devices.

The program runs on Python 3, and requires dependencies to be installed. Python versions 3.9 to 3.12 have been tested.

## **Install ezshare_resmed**
1. Install Python 3

A Quick Guide for Installing Python 3 on Common Operating Systems

1. [Install on Windows](#windows)
2. [Install on macOS](#macos)
3. [Install on Linux](#linux)

### Windows ![Windows](img/windows_65.png)
1. Open a command window, type `winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12`

2. Once Python is installed, you should be able to open a command window, type `python`, hit ENTER, and see a Python prompt opened. Type `quit()` to exit it. You should also be able to run the command `pip` and see its options. If both of these work, then you are ready to go.
  - If you cannot run `python` or `pip` from a command prompt, you may need to add the Python installation directory path to the Windows PATH variable
    - The easiest way to do this is to find the new shortcut for Python in your start menu, right-click on the shortcut, and find the folder path for the `python.exe` file
      - For Python3, this will likely be something like `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312`
    - Open your Advanced System Settings window, navigate to the "Advanced" tab, and click the "Environment Variables" button
    - Create a new system variable:
      - Variable name: `PYTHON_HOME`
      - Variable value: <your_python_installation_directory>
    - Now modify the PATH system variable by appending the text `;%PYTHON_HOME%\;%PYTHON_HOME%;%PYTHON_HOME%\Scripts\` to the end of it.
    - Close out your windows, open a command window and make sure you can run the commands `python` and `pip`

### macOS ![MacOS](img/apple_65.png)
macOS comes with a native version of Python but it is not recommended to use system Python.

There are a couple of ways we can install Python3 on your MacOS operating system:

#### Option 1: Install the official Python release

1. Browse to the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click on the "Download Python 3.x.x" button on the page
3. Walk through the steps of the installer wizard to install Python3
4. Once installed, the wizard will open a Finder window with some `.command` files in it
    - Double-click the `Install Certificates.command` file and the `Update Shell Profile.command` file to run each of them
    - Close the windows once they are finished
6. Open your **Terminal** application and run the command `python3` to enter the Python interactive command line. Issue the command `quit()` to exit. Also make sure PIP (the Python package manager) is installed by issuing the command `pip3 -V`. It should display the current version of PIP as well as Python (which should be some release of Python3).
7. You're all done. Python is installed and ready to use.

#### Option 2: Install with Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a MacOS Linux-like package manager. Walk through the below steps to install Homebrew and an updated Python interpreter along with it.

1. Open your **Terminal** application and run: `xcode-select --install`. This will open a window. Click **'Get Xcode'** and install it from the app store.
2. Install Homebrew. Run: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
   - You can also find this command on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/)
3. Install latest Python3 with `brew install python`
4. Once Python is installed, you should be able to open your **Terminal** application, type `python3`, hit ENTER, and see a Python 3.X.X prompt opened. Type `quit()` to exit it. You should also be able to run the command `pip3` and see its options. If both of these work, then you are ready to go.

### Linux ![Linux](img/linux_65.png)
- **Raspberry Pi OS** may need Python and PIP
  - Install them: `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`
- **Debian (Ubuntu)** distributions may need Python and PIP
  - Update the list of available APT repos with `sudo apt update`
  - Install Python and PIP: `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`
- **RHEL (CentOS)** distributions usually need PIP
  - Install the EPEL package: `sudo yum install -y epel-release`
  - Install PIP: `sudo yum install -y python3-pip`
- **Arch** may need Python and PIP
  - Refresh pacman database and update system: `sudo pacman -Syu`
  - Install PIP: `sudo pacman -S python python-pip`
